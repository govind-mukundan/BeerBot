-------- Hardware ---------
--> Tested with default pinout on http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/GLCDks0108. See pinout A in the Table.
--> Note that you have to connect a 10kPot to adjust contrast and pull the RESET line of the GLCD HIGH via a 100 ohm resistor.
--> Bitmaps required were created using 64x64 pixel images and the BitmapConverter Tool in the GLCD library. Note that the converter
    does not run properly in Ubuntu, so it's best to use Windows for it.
